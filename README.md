#### Description: 

Pixelator is a painting application, similar to MS Paint, except you can only paint in pixels.
There are a bunch of colors, you can save your work and you can use the "bucket" function like in paint.


#### Features:
- Normal drawing: You can draw by clikcing on the colors buttons.

- Eraser: it's basically just ilke the normal drawing pencil except it's colored white.

- Bucket: Like microsoft's bucket, it fills the area you click on with the chosen color. Note that you must choose the color before the bucket, otherwise you will just enter the "drawing mode"

- Saving: After you are satisfied with your amazing drawing, you can save it with the saving button on the far left. After clicked, you will be able to choose the directory and name for your creation. Note that you do not need to add an extension to the file name. The program will automatically add the .PNG extension
